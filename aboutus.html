                <h1>Brief Introduction of Milk</h1>
                <p>Essay on Milk: Milk is generally thought of as the perfect food. It should form an essential part of everyone's daily diet. 
                    Since it has a great nourishing value, doctors prescribe having a glass of milk every day. It is good for everyone but it is particularly so for growing children, old people and expecting mothers.</p>

            <h1>About the Chocolate</h>
            <p>Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a 
                liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about 32 °C (90 °F).
                Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs.</p>
